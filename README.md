This is a NetSuite MapReduce script for integrating Shopify orders with NetSuite and creating corresponding Cash Sales records. The script fetches orders from Shopify's API, checks for duplicate entries in NetSuite, and creates new Cash Sales records for non-duplicate orders. Here's an overview of its structure:

getInputData: Retrieves Shopify orders for the current day that have been shipped.
map: For each order, it checks if a Cash Sale has already been created. If not, it creates a new Cash Sale in NetSuite.
checkDuplicateCashSale: Checks if a Cash Sale for a given Shopify order ID already exists in NetSuite.
createCashSales: Creates a Cash Sale record for each Shopify order, setting customer details, item lines, and custom fields.
summarize/reduce: Placeholder functions for additional processing if needed.
